Devilspie2 - perform scripted actions on windows as they are created
.SH Description
.B Devilspie2
is a program that detects windows as they are created, and performs scripted

customization.

More details in /usr/share/doc/devilspie2.

.SH Options
.IP "--version"
Displays the version of Devilspie2.
.IP "--folder folder"
Sets the folder where the LUA scripts are loaded from.
