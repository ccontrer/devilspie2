Installation:
-------------

Building Devilspie2 requires pkg-config, gtk, wnck and lua libraries. On a
Debian system, installing the following packages should do it:

pkg-config
libglib2.0-dev
liblua5.1-0-dev
libwnck-3-dev
libgtk-3-dev

on a system still using Gtk version 2 replace the wnck and gtk libs with:

libwnck-dev
libgtk2.0-dev


To build, you simply do a

	make

(which will build with Gtk3 libs) or

	make GTK2=on

to make the build use the Gtk2 libs.

This will in the end create the devilspie2 binary in the bin/ folder.
To build the same executable, but with debugging enabled, run

	make DEBUG=1.


To install Devilspie2 system-wide - simply run make install as superuser:

	su -c "make install"

or on systems using sudo:

	sudo make install

depending on your system setup. This will default to /usr/local, installing the
binary to /usr/local/bin - this can be changed using PREFIX variable, and need
to applied all through the build system - the PREFIX is used to make the
location of translations known to all code:

	make PREFIX=/usr
	sudo make install
