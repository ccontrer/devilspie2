Installation:
-------------

Devilspie2 requires pkg-config, gtk, wnck and lua libraries. On a Debian system, 
installing the following packages should do it:

pkg-config
libwnck-dev 
libgtk2.0-dev 
libglib2.0-dev
liblua5.1-0-dev


To build, you simply do a

	make 

this will in the end create the devilspie2 binary in the bin/ folder.
To build the same executable, but with debugging enabled, run 

	make DEBUG=1.


To install Devilspie2 system-wide - simply run

	make install 

as root:

	su -c "make install"

or on systems using sudo:

	sudo make install

This will default to /usr/local, installing the binary to /usr/local/bin - this
can be changed using PREFIX variable:

	make install PREFIX=/usr
