Devilspie 2
-----------

Devilspie 2 is based on the excellent program Devil's Pie by Ross Burton, and 
takes a folder as indata, and checks that folder for LUA scripts. These 
scripts are run each time a window is opened, and the rules in them are applied 
on the window.

Unfortunately the rules of the original Devils Pie are not supported.

If you don't give devilspie2 any folder with --folder, it will read LUA scripts
from ~/.devilspie2, and this folder will be created if it doesn't already exist. 
This folder is changeable with the --folder option. If devilspie2 doesn't find
any LUA files in the folder, it will stop execution.

simple script example:

---------------------8<---------------------

-- the debug_print command does only print anything to stdout 
-- if devilspie2 is run using the --debug option
debug_print("Window Name: "..	get_window_name());
debug_print("Application name: "..get_application_name())

-- I want my Xfce4-terminal to the right on the second screen of my two-monitor 
-- setup,
if (get_window_name()=="Terminal") then
	-- x,y, xsize, ysize
	set_window_geometry(1600,300,900,700);
end


-- For some reason thunar doesn't always get to the top when it is started, 
-- but sometimes it starts below the rest of the windows - this little snippet 
-- solves that.
if (get_application_name()=="Thunar") then
	set_on_top();
end

Building
--------

to build devilspie2, create a build folder and step into it

mkdir build
cd build

and run cmake targeting the folder containing the file CMakeLists.txt 
(which basically should be the folder above)

cmake ..

if you want to create makefiles for a debug build, use 

cmake .. -DDEBUG=on 

instead. This creates necessary makefiles - now run make to actually build 
devilspie2:

make

this will in the end result in the executable bin/devilspie2.
If you want more detailed output of the make command, run

make VERBOSE=1
